## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- User authentication is handled by **Appwrite Auth**
- On app load:
  - The app checks for the current logged-in user
  - Redux state is updated accordingly
- Auth state controls:
  - Navigation visibility
  - Access to protected routes (Add/Edit posts)

  ---

## 📝 Post Creation Flow

1. User fills in:
   - Title
   - Content (Rich Text Editor)
   - Featured Image
   - Status (Active / Inactive)
2. Slug is auto-generated from the title
3. Image is uploaded to **Appwrite Storage**
4. Appwrite returns a `fileId`
5. `fileId` is stored in the database as `featuredImage`
6. Post document is created in Appwrite Database
7. User is redirected to the post page

---

## 🖼️ Image Handling

- Images are stored in **Appwrite Storage**
- Database stores **only the file ID**
- Images are displayed using Appwrite file preview/view APIs
- Storage permissions allow public image access
